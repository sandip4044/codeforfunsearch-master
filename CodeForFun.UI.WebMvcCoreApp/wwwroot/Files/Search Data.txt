But in ASP.NET In addition to improved performance over the interpreted model,
pages that are compiled into classes can be debugged using the same
debugging tools available to desktop applications or component developers.
Errors with pages are generated as compiler errors, and there is a good chance
that most errors will be net found at compilation time instead of runtime, because
VB.NET and C# are both strongly typed languages. Plus, all the tools available
to the .NET developer are applicable to the .aspx developer.
6) In ASP.NET it is no longer possible NET to include executable code outside the
scope of a function within a script block marked as runat=server, and conversely,
it is no longer possible to define a function within a pair of server-side script tags.

Sharp). This language makes full use of .NET. It is a pure object oriented language.
C# is a simple, modern object oriented and type-safe programming language derived
from C and C++. It will immediately be familiar to C and C++ programmers. C# aims to
combine the high productivity of visual basic and the raw power of C++.

For loop executes a statement or a block of statements repeatedly until a
specified expression evaluates to false. For loop is handy for iterating over arrays and
for sequential processing. In the following example, the value of int i is written to the
console and i is incremented each time through the loop by 1.
